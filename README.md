- 👋 Hi, I’m Guillermo Castro, aka @codegeek
- 👀 I’m interested in everything related to computer programming. I've been doing Java development for over 25 years, but I've also used other languages (Python, PHP, Perl, etc)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about [Social Web Protocols](https://www.w3.org/TR/social-web-protocols/), for a project I have in mind, [jFed](https://github.com/jfed-dev).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects
- 📫 You can send me an email: github [at] codegeek.dev, or reach me at <a rel="me nofollow" href="https://fosstodon.org/@codegeek">Mastodon</a>
